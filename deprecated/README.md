## About ./deprecated/notal-old and ./deprecated/notal-root

./deprecated file contains old versions of Notal. notal-old was built with [NextUI](https://nextui.org/) and lacked many things. I refactored the code then made `notal-root`. Which later on, i refactored code again and switched to `notal-ts` with TypeScript and currently building it back from scratch.
You can use same .env.local file from `notal-ts` to `notal-root & notal-old`, because they use same API's
